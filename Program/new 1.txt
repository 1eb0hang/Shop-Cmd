purchase details, taking into account various factors such as base charge, item
charge, discounts based on purchase amount, and more. The program should prompt
the user for the necessary information and display the calculated charges for each
customer in a specified format

charge = base_charge + items * item_charge

Thinking of having diffrent levels of the program:

lvl 1 - Menu

	PRODUCTS
	ACCOUNT
	CHECKOUT

lvl 2 
PRODUCTS
	{list of all the products, with numbers to show how to select each}
	
ACCOUNT
	{account details, include coupons, discounts, etc}
	
CHECKOUT
	{list of products about to be bought with prices and descounts}
	{option to check out with receit}
